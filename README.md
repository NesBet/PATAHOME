Back Story
As an aspiring real estate enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by the process of finding the perfect property. Growing up, I had the privilege of witnessing my parents' journey in acquiring their dream home. The countless hours spent scouring through listings, attending open houses, and negotiating with agents left a lasting impression. I saw firsthand the challenges they faced in finding a property that truly aligned with their needs and preferences.

Determined to improve this process, I embarked on a mission to develop a more intuitive and user-friendly real estate platform. Drawing inspiration from my own experiences and the pain points shared by friends and family, I set out to create PATAHOME.
